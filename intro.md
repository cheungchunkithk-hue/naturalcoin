# Introduction

**Natural Coin** is a new philosophy of money built on the rhythm of *circulation*, *decay*, and *resonance*.

It aims to prevent monopoly, reduce hoarding, and reward invisible contributions such as care, education, and environmental stewardship.

### The Three Principles
1. **Circulation** — Value must keep moving.
2. **Decay** — What does not flow must fade.
3. **Resonance** — Every act leaves an echo of value.

> “Wealth is not accumulation, but the sound of balance returning to nature.”
